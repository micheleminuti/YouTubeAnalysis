As developers we tend to experience failure repeatedly. From breaking builds to production outages, from buggy features to startups that fold: failure always lurks around the corner. What if, instead of trying to avoid or minimise failure, we embrace it? We'll learn this requires at least a different mindset, and in most cases a different approach to dealing with failures.

DYhbNSGUQKc,How to survive as a developer in the exponential age of AI by Sander Hoogendoorn,"Artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented pace, transforming the software development landscape. While AI currently serves as an assistant, the emergence of autonomous AI raises significant questions about its impact on developers. Will we be replaced by AGI, agentic AI, or the next energy-adsorbing, hyped breakthrough from OpenAI, Meta, or Google? What exactly is vibe coding? And can we stay ahead, adapt, and lead in this AI-driven world?

In his signature charismatic style, Sander Hoogendoorn, CTO at iBOOD.com and a seasoned developer with over four decades of experience, confronts these pressing issues head-on. He will explore the tangible benefits AI offers developers and critically assess how AI reshapes our approaches to work, learning, and innovation. What can AI truly do for developers today?

The discussion will delve into code quality, balancing short-term gains with long-term maintainability, new forms of technical debt, and understanding who uses which tools and why. Most importantly, he will address the looming question: Will AI replace developers, or can we harness its (often hallucinating) power to tackle even more significant challenges and even more quickly resolve larger business problems?

Join this thought-provoking session to cut through the hype, challenge prevailing assumptions, and discover how you, as a developer, can not only survive but thrive in the exponential age of AI.",2025-04-07T13:45:19Z,853,22,PLRsbF2sD7JVpZ3O01elefwrp9l4yBWoXu

i3deSBTeLS0,Hunting with Stream Gatherers by Piotr Przybył,"Streams were a very nice addition to Java 8, based on lambdas. They allow streamlined data processing without side effects, taking us gently towards functional style. With newer additions to Java, like records and pattern matching, they shine even more in data-driven flows.
However, they don’t come without flaws.
For starters, the only available extension point was collectors: if your needs for gathering data weren’t satisfied by the whole Collectors ZOO, you could always fall back to creating your own Collector. However, if map, filter or flatMap weren’t enough, you couldn’t add your own intermediate operation.
Secondly, parallel streams were limited to ForkJoin pool, effectively rendering them unusable for scenarios involving any IO.
Since Java 24, Stream Gatherers will be our extension point for intermediate operations in streams.
If you’d like to comprehend how they work, find nice use cases and hunt for more performance, this talk is for you.",2025-04-07T13:45:23Z,280,9,PLRsbF2sD7JVpZ3O01elefwrp9l4yBWoXu

Rc6m_I1RkXM,Continuations: The magic behind virtual threads in Java by Balkrishna Rawool,"Have you wondered how virtual threads in Java are able to provide such high scalability and how is JVM able to switch between so many virtual threads while executing a single platform thread? If you did then this talk is for you.

Continuations is the magic that powers Virtual Threads. A continuation can be viewed as a representation of the current state of the program or it can be viewed as a reference to the rest of the program. It helps us to pause execution of a program (or part thereof) and then resume it later. This ability to pause/resume a program is a powerful mechanism and is the basis for providing virtual threads.

This talk explains what Continuations are and where they are used. But more importantly, we write our own simple VirtualThread class using the Continuation API provided by JDK. This will give you clear idea about the role of continuations in the nature of virtual threads.",2025-04-07T13:45:21Z,564,19,PLRsbF2sD7JVpZ3O01elefwrp9l4yBWoXu

IYnvxc_Kp9Q,GraalVM in action: Building a Polyglot Rule Engine for Dynamic Business Logic,"By Rick Ossendrijver and Enric Sala

In today's fast-paced tech world, backend systems need to be flexible and self-service to support evolving business needs. For Picnic, this means building a backend that lets operators and analysts directly define and manage the logic driving customer interactions, product personalization and internal workflows. 

Our solution is a Rule Engine platform where operators can easily attach logic and effects to events by creating, testing and managing their own rules. Powered by GraalVM's polyglot capabilities, it allows analysts and other stakeholders to write rules in JavaScript or Python. This event-driven system enables self-service without developer involvement. It handles actions across the Picnic system landscape, from updating customer data to triggering communications.

In this talk, we will discuss the architecture behind our Rule Engine and share some of the challenges we faced with GraalVM’s polyglot capabilities. We will explain how we made Java-based event data accessible in guest languages. In addition, we will show how we provided extra context from our systems to the rules, and designed a simple DSL for data retrieval and action triggering. Finally, we’ll cover how we ensure fairness and maintain performance. 

Come and learn how you can leverage the potential of GraalVM!",2025-04-07T13:45:21Z,957,18,PLRsbF2sD7JVpZ3O01elefwrp9l4yBWoXu

In the classic approach we use multiple test environments and separate QA engineers to keep the cowboys at bay. This however requires a complex setup of test data with high coupling between systems and teams, causes constant handovers and a long feedback cycle. The result is often a misguided feeling of confidence when going live.

Alternatively, you can choose the path of a ninja - one that better fits modern software development which relies on autonomous teams, devops skill set and decoupled microservice architecture. At Rabobank hundreds of squads apply various tools and techniques to successfully go straight to production multiple times a day.

She tried to do it as efficiently as possible, even made a plan on how to approach it. It made her think, if only work was like this....

It is so fun to play video games, you feel incentivized to continue playing, engaged to keep exploring, and rewarded when you complete a quest. Sometimes we will even go out of our way to gather some tedious collectables to make sure we finish the game to 100%. But in comparison, why can work be so boring? Why is it so difficult ourselves to do similar tedious tasks in a work setting when we (gladly) do them in a game?

Sadly we can’t choose our managers, but what would our day look like if it was arranged by a game designer? Sara and Mandy will explore what game techniques help motivate us, and what actually makes game so fun. Based on that we will see what is possible to match to the ‘real world’.

Vv4rN7jhId0,"Dockerfiles, Buildpacks, Jib and more ... what's the best way to run your Java code in Containers?","By Matthias Haeussler

A typical workflow in a modern software dev project often looks like: Build code, put the built artifact into a container image, put the container image into a registry and deploy to Kubernetes. Each step has its own requirements and pitfalls alike. The overall goal is most often to bake those steps into easily repeatable pipelines and enable a high degree of automation and standardization.

Dockerfiles seems to be the choice with the highest adoption when it comes to containerizing code artefacts. However most Dockerfiles (and also most sample's of Dockerfiles you find in tutorials) do not exploit it to the full potential.
There are a lot of improvements to be done in how to build and optimize for VM-based applications.

The talk will give deeper insights by comparing (simple and multi-stage) Dockerfiles to Cloud-Native Buildpacks (buildpacks.io/paketo.io), Google’s JIB and jlink under the evaluation criteria of

build size
standardization
robustness
memory configuration

bRwVxIn8MKU,Java's Concurrency Journey Continues! Exploring Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values,"By Hanno Embregts

Java's concurrency journey has been a long and winding one. We departed from the 'classic threads' station and traveled through Runnables, ExecutorServices, CompletableFutures and ForkJoinPools, before finally arriving at 'virtual threads'. But does 'finally' mean that we've arrived at our final destination, or is it a transfer at best?

Now that virtual threads are available, our Java programs will likely use an abundance of threads. This increase in thread count will immediately make thread coordination, observability and isolation more difficult. Two new Java features are currently in development that might make things a bit easier: Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values.

In this talk, we'll introduce and demonstrate these new features, and how they can help address the challenges that have emerged since the introduction of virtual threads.

fbTPLPKAuhA,Quantum 2 0 is here and it's ready to change the world! by Petra Wevers,"Quantum 2.0 is here, and it's ready to change the world!

This disruptive technology delivers exciting new innovations in areas far out of reach of our current computers.
Cool stuff is on its way, like for challenges in pattern recognition, optimalisation, modeling natural processes, and precision measurements.

However, as always with new technology, this has a flip side: almost all of our current cryptography is broken in devastating ways!
The cryptography we've relied on for so many years, like RSA and ECC, no longer protects our data.
Knowing that data being harvested today can be decrypted makes the need for action even more urgent.

So, what can we do?

Whilst there are no ready-to-go-trails, we have excellent guidance in the PQC-Migrationhandbook by the AIVD.
Dealing with this huge cybersecurity problem boils down to implementing cryptographic agility and quantum safe cryptography.
But what does this actually mean?
And how does this translate to the work of developers and technical architects?

In this talk I'll be sharing the most valuable insights and lessons we've gathered so far.",2025-04-07T13:45:23Z,317,4,PLRsbF2sD7JVpZ3O01elefwrp9l4yBWoXu

However there can be different blockers to migrate from Maven to Gradle (like release management or CI/CD pipelines), also in a large organization it'll require to teach a lot of engineers the new tooling and there can be pitfalls.
The good news is that Maven has a lot of potential to speed up the builds.

In this session we'll talk about possible ways to optimize it, starting with trivial things like choosing proper JDK, upgrading to Kotlin 2.0 K2, stop building and deploying redundant artifacts. Also we'll talk about Apache Build Cache and Develocity extensions, extracting code generation to jar dependency and how it will boost the experience in the IDE.
Then we'll dig deeper to how the Maven Reactor works under the hood and how it builds multi-module projects, what's the main problem of scalability/parallelization there.
In this section it will be explained why modularization is a key factor, how to find build bottlenecks and how to modularize the build.

r4z9kTrGeTs,Effective software design: The role of men in debugging patriarchy in IT by Kenny Baas Schwegler,"Want to know how patriarchy influences software design and learn practical steps you can immediately apply to foster a shift towards a more inclusive environment. Effective software design relies on integrating diverse perspectives throughout its development process. Research shows that teams with a neuro-diverse background excel in decision-making due to their ability to consider a wider range of ideas, foresee a greater variety of potential challenges, and develop more creative solutions. This becomes particularly clear in collaborative modelling for Domain-Driven Design. The inclusion of varied viewpoints enhances the ability of software models to address business problems effectively, increasing the likelihood of achieving significant product breakthroughs.

However, one social system significantly blocks the flow of development of these diverse perspectives: patriarchy. Patriarchy is a social construct where men predominantly hold power and exercise dominance in areas such as political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and property ownership. Feminists have been actively working to challenge and change this patriarchal system for the better. Despite these efforts, the system still favours men, maintaining their dominant status, and will not evolve without their active involvement. Additionally, patriarchy limits men as well, endorsing only traits traditionally seen as 'masculine' and disregarding those seen as 'feminine.' This raises the question: how do we start the process of eMANcipation, involve men in the movement towards feminism, and as a result, improve our software design practices?

Join me in this talk as I explore patriarchy and its significant effects on software design. Drawing from personal experiences, I will discuss how patriarchy affects men and argue that for genuine equality, men need to undergo changes too. I will demonstrate how incorporating Process Work and Deep Democracy into software design can bring about the necessary transformation. By adopting the idea of role fluidity, we can start breaking down the patriarchal system in software design, ensuring that every perspective is appreciated and nurtured.",2025-04-07T13:45:26Z,424,10,PLRsbF2sD7JVpZ3O01elefwrp9l4yBWoXu

Then comes the real fun: your feature depends on three other services, but who owns them? Where are the APIs? Slack messages go unanswered, and the internal docs might as well be written in hieroglyphs. By the time you finally write your first line of code, you’re not just frustrated, you’re drained.

This is the hidden cost of poor Developer Experience. Projects stall, innovation slows, and engineering teams struggle to deliver value.

As a data visualization practitioner, I frequently draw inspiration from the diverse and rapidly expanding community, particularly through challenges like #TidyTuesday. However, the sheer volume of remarkable visualizations quickly overwhelmed my manual curation methods—from Pinterest boards to Notion pages. This created a significant bottleneck in my workflow, as I found myself spending more time cataloging charts than actively creating them.

In this talk, I will present a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based retrieval system that I designed specifically for data visualizations. I will detail the methodology behind this system, illustrating how I addressed my own workflow inefficiencies by transforming a dispersed collection of charts into a semantically searchable knowledge base. This project serves as a practical example of applying advanced AI techniques to enhance creative technical work, demonstrating how a specialized retrieval system can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of data visualization creation process.

The context data provided to the LLM must be produced in real-time to enable it to react intelligently at human perceivable latencies (a second or two at most). If the application takes longer to react, humans would perceive it as laggy and unintelligent.
In this talk, we will introduce context engineering and motivate for real-time context engineering for interactive applications. We will also demonstrate how to integrate real-time context data from applications inside Python agents using the Hopsworks feature store and corresponding application IDs. Application IDs are the key to unlock application context data for agents and LLMs. We will walk through an example of an interactive application (TikTok clone) that we make AI-enabled with Hopsworks.

DxwDaoUijTc,KEYNOTE: Hannes Mühleisen - Data Architecture Turned Upside Down | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

Every data architecture diagram out there makes it abundantly clear who's in charge: At the bottom sits the analyst, above that is an API server, and on the very top sits the mighty data warehouse. This pattern is so ingrained we never ever question its necessity, despite its various issues like slow data response time, multi-level scaling issues, and massive cost.

But there is another way: Disconnect of storage and compute enables localization of query processing closer to people, leading to much snappier responses, natural scaling with client-side query processing, and much reduced cost.

In this talk, it will be discussed how modern data engineering paradigms like decomposition of storage, single-node query processing, and lakehouse formats enable a radical departure from the tired three-tier architecture. By inverting the architecture we can put user's needs first. We can rely on commoditised components like object store to enable fast, scalable, and cost-effective solutions.

9YAVD3kwU58,Rodrigo Loredo & Oscar Ligthart - Orchestrating success | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

At Vinted, Europe’s largest second-hand marketplace, over 20 decentralized data teams generate, transform, and build products on petabytes of data. Each team utilizes their own tools, workflows, and expertise. Coordinating data pipeline creation across such diverse teams presents significant challenges. These include complex inter-team dependencies, inconsistent scheduling solutions, and rapidly evolving requirements.

This talk is aimed at data engineers, platform engineers, and technical leads with experience in workflow orchestration and will demonstrate how we empower teams at Vinted to define data pipelines quickly and reliably. We will present our user-friendly abstraction layer built on top of Apache Airflow, enhanced by a Python code generator. This abstraction simplifies upgrades and migrations, removes scheduler complexity, and supports Vinted’s rapid growth. Attendees will learn how Python abstractions and code generation can standardize pipeline development across diverse teams, reduce operational complexity, and enable greater flexibility and control in large-scale data organizations. Through practical lessons and real-world examples of our abstraction interface, we will offer insights into designing scheduler-agnostic architectures for successful data pipeline orchestration.

5i8tEvrYEyQ,Raphael Mitsch - Sieves - Plug-and-Play NLP Pipelines With Zero-Shot Models | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

Generative models are dominating the spotlight lately - and rightly so. Their flexibility and zero-shot capabilities make it incredibly fast to prototype NLP applications. However, one-shotting complex NLP problems often isn't the best long-term strategy. Decomposing problems into modular, pipelined tasks leads to better debuggability, greater interpretability, and more reliable performance.

This modular pipeline approach pairs naturally with zero- and few-shot (ZFS) models, enabling rapid yet robust prototyping without requiring large datasets or fine-tuning. Crucially, many real-world applications need structured data outputs—not free-form text. Generative models often struggle to consistently produce structured results, which is why enforcing structured outputs is now a core feature across contemporary NLP tools (like Outlines, DSPy, LangChain, Ollama, vLLM, and others).

For engineers building NLP pipelines today, the landscape is fragmented. There’s no single standard for structured generation yet, and switching between tools can be costly and frustrating. The NLP tooling landscape lacks a flexible, model-agnostic solution that minimizes setup overhead, supports structured outputs, and accelerates iteration.

Introducing Sieves: a modular toolkit for building robust NLP document processing pipelines using ZFS models.

Not all mistakes in machine learning are equal—a false negative in fraud detection or medical diagnosis can be far costlier than a false positive. Cost-sensitive learning helps navigate these trade-offs by incorporating error costs into the training process, leading to smarter decision-making. This talk introduces Empulse, an open-source Python package that brings cost-sensitive learning into scikit-learn. Attendees will learn why standard models fall short in cost-sensitive scenarios and how to build better classifiers with Scikit-Learn and Empulse.

m6OW9pLCvjw,George Chouliaras & Antonio Castelli - Scaling Trust | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

Recently, the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) technologies into both our personal and professional lives has surged. In most organizations, the deployment of GenAI applications is on the rise, and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Evaluating GenAI systems presents unique challenges not present in traditional ML. The main peculiarity is the absence of ground truth for textual metrics such as: text clarity, location extraction accuracy, factual accuracy and so on. Nevertheless the non-negligible model serving cost demands an even more thorough evaluation of the system to be deployed in production.

Defining the metric ground truth is a costly and time consuming process requiring human annotation. To address this, we are going to present how to evaluate LLM-based applications by leveraging LLMs themselves as evaluators. Moreover we are going to outline the complexities and evaluation methods for LLM-based Agents which operate with autonomy and present further evaluation challenges. Lastly, we will explore the critical role of evaluation in the GenAI lifecycle and outline the steps taken to integrate these processes seamlessly.

Whether you are an AI practitioner, user or enthusiast, join us to gain insights into the future of GenAI evaluation and its impact on enhancing application performance.

For well over a decade, Python notebooks revolutionized our field. They gave us so much creative freedom and dramatically lowered the entry barrier for newcomers. Yet despite all this ... it has been a decade! And the notebook is still in roughly the same form factor.

So what if we allow ourselves to rethink notebooks ... really rethink it! What features might we come up with? Can we make the notebook understand datasources? What about LLMs? Can we generate widgets on the fly? What if we make changes to Python itself?

This presentation will be a stream of demos that help paint a picture of what the future might hold. I will share my latest work in the anywidget/marimo ecosystem as well as some new hardware integrations.

The main theme that I will work towards: if you want better notebooks, reactive Python might very well be the future.

In this brave new world of vibe coding and YOLO-to-prod mentality, let’s take a step back and keep things grounded (pun intended). None of us would ever deploy a classical ML model to production without clearly defined metrics and proper evaluation, so let's talk about methodologies for measuring performance of LLM-powered chatbots. Think of retriever recall, answer relevancy, correctness, faithfulness and hallucination rates. With the wild west of metric standards still in full swing, I’ll guide you through the challenges of curating a synthetic test set, and selecting suitable metrics and open-source packages that help evaluating your use case. Everything is possible, from simple LLM-as-a-judge approaches like those inherent to many packages like MLFLow now up to complex multi-step quantification approaches with Ragas. If you work in the GenAI space or with LLM-powered chatbots, this session is for you! Prior or background knowledge is of advantage, but not required.

HzUUuRKFbws,Dima Baranetskyi - Kafka Internals I Wish I Knew Sooner | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

Most of us start with Kafka by building a simple producer/consumer demo. It just works — until it doesn’t. Suddenly, disk space isn’t freed up after data “expires,” rebalances loop endlessly during deploys, and strange errors about missing leaders clog your logs.
In the panic, we dive into Kafka’s ocean of config options — hoping something will stick. Sound familiar?

This talk is a collection of hard-won lessons — not flashy tricks, but the kind of insights you only gain after operating Kafka in production for years. You’ll walk away with mental models that make Kafka’s internal behavior more predictable and less surprising.

We’ll cover:

- Storage internals: Why expired data doesn’t always free space — and how Kafka actually reclaims disk
- Transactions & delivery semantics: What “exactly-once” really means, and when it silently downgrades
- Consumer group rebalancing: Why rebalances loop, and how the controller’s hidden behavior affects them

If you’ve used Kafka — or plan to — these insights will save you hours of frustration and debugging.
A basic understanding of partitions, replication, and Kafka’s general architecture will help get the most out of this session.

Ethics is often treated like a product feature—something to be added at the end, polished for compliance, or marketed for trust. But what if that mindset is exactly what’s holding us back?
In this keynote, we’ll challenge the idea that ethics is optional or external to the development process. We’ll explore how ethical blind spots in AI systems—from biased models to black-box decisions to unsustainable compute—aren’t just philosophical dilemmas, but human failures with real-world consequences.
You’ll learn how to spot ethical risks before they become failures, and discover practical tools and mindsets to build AI that earns trust—without compromising on innovation. From responsible data practices to transparency techniques and green AI strategies, we’ll connect the dots between values and code.
This isn’t just a lecture—it’s a call to rethink how we build the future of AI—together.

bFTPSq3l-lE,Sayak Paul & Benjamin Bossan - Designing tests for ML libraries | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

In this talk, we will cover how to write effective test cases for machine learning (ML) libraries that are used by hundreds of thousands of users on a regular basis. Tests, despite their well-established need for trust and foolproofing, often get less prioritized. Later, this can wreak havoc on massive codebases, with a high likelihood of introducing breaking changes and other unpleasant situations. This talk deals with our approach to testing our ML libraries, which serve a wide user base. We will cover a wide variety of topics, including the mindset and the necessity of minimal-yet-sufficient testing, all the way up to sharing some practical examples of end-to-end test suites.

NC_7RbJ0yp4,Bauke Brenninkmeijer - Context is King | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

Grounding Large Language Models in your specific data is crucial, but notoriously challenging. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the common pattern, yet practical implementations are often brittle, suffering from poor retrieval, ineffective chunking, and context limitations, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant answers. The emergence of massive context windows (1M+ tokens) seems to offer a simpler path – just put all your data in the prompt! But does it truly solve the ""needle in a haystack"" problem, or introduce new challenges like prohibitive costs and information getting lost in the middle? This talk dives deep into the engineering realities. We'll dissect common RAG failure modes, explore techniques for building robust RAG systems (advanced retrieval, re-ranking, query transformations), and critically evaluate the practical viability, costs, and limitations of leveraging long context windows for complex data tasks in Python. Leave understanding the real trade-offs to make informed architectural decisions for building reliable, data-grounded GenAI applications.

uKjo8DfU_w8,Wesley Boelrijk - Time Series Decomposition with PyMC | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

Forecasting time series can be messy, data is often missing, noisy, or full of structural changes like holidays, outliers, or evolving patterns. This talk shows how to build interpretable time series decomposition models using PyMC, a modern probabilistic programming library.

We’ll break time series into trend, seasonality, and noise components using engineered time features (e.g., Fourier and Radial Basis Functions). You’ll also learn how to model correlated series using hierarchical priors, letting multiple time series ""learn from each other."" As a case study, we’ll analyze Formula 1 lap time data to compare drivers and explore performance consistency using Bayesian posteriors.

This is a hands-on, code-first talk for data scientists, ML engineers, and researchers curious about Bayesian modeling (or Formula 1). Familiarity with Python and basic statistics is helpful, but no deep knowledge of Bayes is required.

iC9F7Az5olQ,Netesh & Nazlı Alagöz - Causal Inference Framework for incrementality | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

This talk dives into the challenge of measuring the causal impact of app installs on customer loyalty and value, a question at the heart of data-driven marketing. While randomized controlled trials are the gold standard, they’re rarely feasible in this context. Instead, we’ll explore how observational causal inference methods can be thoughtfully applied to estimate incremental value with careful consideration of confounding, selection, and measurement biases.

This session is designed for data scientists, marketing analysts, and applied researchers with a working knowledge of statistics and causal inference concepts. We’ll keep the tone practical and informative, focusing on real-world challenges and solutions rather than heavy mathematical derivations.

Attendees will learn:

- How to design robust observational studies for business impact
- Strategies for covariate selection and bias mitigation
- The use of multiple statistical and design-based causal inference approaches
- Methods for validating and refuting causal claims in the absence of true randomization. We’ll share actionable insights, code snippets, and a GitHub repository with example workflows so you can apply these techniques in your own organization. By the end of the talk, you’ll be equipped to design more transparent and credible causal studies-and make better decisions about where to invest your marketing dollars.

Requirements: A basic understanding of causal inference and Python is recommended. Materials and relevant links will be shared during the session

E2PUxfzhLXo,Konstantinos Tsoumas - Uncertainty Unleashed | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

There are a lot of models working in production as you're reading this. Lots of them are giving uncalibrated outputs without being explicit on how much one can trust the result. Especially when it comes to imbalanced datasets.

More so, relying on biased estimates can lead to overly aggressive decisions. In this hands‑on talk, we’ll demystify conformal methods using MNIST—the world’s favorite handwritten‑digit playground (to make the talk more fun & interactive)- with two goals in mind: explain & prove what an unbiased guarantee is and how it can be calculated but also why should you care and why does it matter so much. Attendees may leave equipped with: uncertainty guarantee understanding in classification, identify common pitfalls that lead to biased uncertainty estimates, how to apply it (even in difficult contexts like imbalanced datasets - an example will be given).

qc0T6Ya04vY,Fabio Lipreri & Gabriele Orlandi - Model Context Protocol | PyData Amsterdam 2025,"www.pydata.org

Large‑language‑model agents are only as useful as the context and tools they can reach.

Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) proposes a universal, bidirectional interface that turns every external system—SQL databases, Slack, Git, web browsers, even your local file‑system—into first‑class “context providers.”

In just 30 minutes we’ll step from high‑level buzzwords to hands‑on engineering details:

- How MCP’s JSON‑RPC message format, streaming channels, and version‑negotiation work under the hood.
- Why per‑tool sandboxing via isolated client processes hardens security (and what happens when an LLM tries rm ‑rf /).
- Techniques for hierarchical context retrieval that stretch a model’s effective window beyond token limits.
- Real‑world patterns for accessing multiple tools—Postgres, Slack, GitHub—and plugging MCP into GenAI applications.

Expect code snippets and lessons from early adoption.

You’ll leave ready to wire your own services into any MCP‑aware model and level‑up your GenAI applications—without the N×M integration nightmare.
